# Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

This repository contains my personal implementation of neural network models, based on Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) tutorials on the basics of neural nets and transformers. The code includes models for bigram language modeling, CNN-based natural language processing, and transformer models. These models are designed to help me understand the basic concepts of neural networks and their applications in NLP.

This code is heavily inspired by Karpathy's own [nn-zero-to-hero code](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero), but is not a direct fork. The code is written in Jupyter notebooks and uses the PyTorch library for building and training the models. Each model is implemented as a standalone notebook and can be run independently.

Please note that this code is not intended for production use (obviously) and should be used for educational purposes only. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contribute!
